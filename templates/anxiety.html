    <h2>🌿 Managing Anxiety</h2>
    <p>Anxiety often appears when we worry about what might happen. Let’s focus on the present moment.</p>

    <h3>💡 Self-Care Tip</h3>
    <p>Ground yourself with the 5-4-3-2-1 technique: notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.</p>

    <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
    <p>Write down your biggest worry right now — then one realistic action you can take about it. Small steps matter!</p>
