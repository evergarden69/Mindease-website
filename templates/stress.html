    <h2>☁️ Coping with Stress</h2>
    <p>Stress is your body’s response to pressure — and learning to calm it makes a huge difference.</p>

    <h3>💡 Self-Care Tip</h3>
    <p>Stretch your shoulders, neck, and back gently. Movement releases tension built up from daily stress.</p>

    <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
    <p>Take a 10-minute walk outside. Focus on your breathing and the colors around you.</p>
